INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the first released alpha-version of FreeRPG.
This is currently a very early, unfinished version for testing out the 
basic systems. So there is not much content to explore. Also there are still
a lot of bugs and issues.


KNOWN ISSUES

-player is unable to die
-limbdamage is not saved
-playeritems reset after loading
-in some cases, entities change their activity after loading


REQUIREMENTS

-Java version 13.0.2 or higher


CONTROLS

ALWAYS enter just ONE character and press enter. Otherwise, the game won't register.

-numpad 4, 2, 6, 8: move around
-a: attack entity next to you
-t: talk
-i: inventory
-s: status
-l: look around
-g: grab item on your tile

when looking around, you can move the cursor the same way like moving on the map.
Press 0 to leave this mode.

When talking or attacking, targets are marked on the map with the letter seen in the menu.
